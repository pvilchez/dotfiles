After having spent a week with the Guelph Seven (http://guelphseven.com), I've 
learned more about vim than I have at any other point in my life. So i've opened up 
my old vimrc file and am going to muck around with it, 'cause I see myself using vim
more regularly now.

If you have any tips, tricks or ideas, let me know! I'd love to hear them.
